## General Requirements
Minimum requirements for SDK include
- Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher
- Internet connection
- Camera
## Permissions:
The Shufti Pro application requires permission to access the following:
- Camera
- External Storage

**Note:** All permissions are handled in the SDK.
## SDK Installation Guide
To integrate Services follow the below steps;
- Download the **shuftipro-sdk.aar** file from Core SDK folder.
- Select **Project** from Android Studio package manager.
- Make a new directory in project level named **libs**.
- Paste **shuftipro-sdk.aar** in libs folder.
- In **build.gradle(Module)** add the following implementation
```
implementation files('../libs/shuftipro-sdk.aar') 
```

## Verification Types You Can Get:
Shufti Pro’s services come in three variations. You have an option of choosing all or any one of them that fulfills your client's requirements. Following are the types of verification services;

**With OCR:** Verification services API embedded with OCR technology can extract personally identifiable information from user’s ID documents and authenticate them as a part of a single identity verification process.

**Without OCR:** In case you are choosing this service, your clients need to provide additional proof of data in the form of identity documents other than verification information.

**Verification Through Hybrid View:** Shufti Pro’s hybrid view includes mobile verifications along with a web view built on HTML 5 that will show the results to the end-user. The verification data will be sent through a JSON object, quite similar to OCR/Non-OCR in the mobile authentication formats. In case the value for OpenViewParameter is set to true, the hybrid view will be enabled, else the other models will be triggered.


## Integration:
A sample project is shown below, that will help you learn to integrate Shufti Pro’s Verification APIs’.
 
**Step 1:** Make an instance
```
    Shuftipro shuftipro = Shuftipro.getInstance();
 ```
**Step 2:** Make AuthKeys object using Client ID and Secret Key
        
        JSONObject AuthKeys = new JSONObject();
        try {
            AuthKeys.put("auth_type","basic_auth");
            AuthKeys.put("client_id", "your-clientId");
            AuthKeys.put("secret_key","your-secretKey");
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
 

Or AuthKeys object using Access Token
        
        JSONObject AuthKeys = new JSONObject();
        try {
            AuthKeys.put("auth_type","access_token");
            AuthKeys.put("access_token","sp-accessToken");
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
 
AuthKeys object parameters are explained [here](#auth-key-object-parameters).

**Step 3:** Make Config object
        
        JSONObject Config=new JSONObject();
        try {
            Config.put("open_webview",false); //pass true for verification through hybrid view
            Config.put("asyncRequest",false);
            Config.put("captureEnabled",false);
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
 
Config object parameters are explained [here](#config-object-parameters).

**Step 4:** Request Object

## Initiate Request
    
    shuftipro.shuftiproVerification(JSONObject: "your-requested-json-object",
                AuthKeys:"authentication-keys-object",
                Config:"configration-objects", 
                parentActivity:"your-caller-activity",
                new ShuftiVerifyListener() {
            @Override
            public void verificationStatus(HashMap<String, String> responseSet) {

                Log.e("Response",responseSet.toString());
                
            }
        });
 

## Auth Key Object Parameters
In this object, we add authorization key in verification request.
* ## Basic Auth
    The server provides authorization keys to clients through Basic Auth header. The IDs’ will be used as usernames while the Secret Key will act as passwords. Upon each API hit, this header will be requested.

* ## Access Token
    Shufti Pro provides a Bearer Access Token Authorization method. The client can generate a temporary access token using the new access token endpoint. The shared token will be used to authorize API requests. The token shared with the client will be valid for 10 minutes and can be used once only.

## Config Object Parameters
In this object, we add an extra configuration of verification that the user wants.
* ## open_webview
    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **boolean**<br>
    Accepted Values: **true, false**<br><br>
This is a boolean type parameter that determines whether to run or terminate the hybrid view. However, its **default value** is set as **false**.

* ## asyncRequest
    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **boolean**<br>
    Accepted Values: **true, false**<br><br>
If the value of this parameter is set to True, the client will get control back and don't have to wait for verification results. However, when the request completes an automated callback is generated.
 
* ## captureEnabled
    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **boolean**<br>
    Accepted Values: **true, false**<br><br>
This parameter identifies whether the client wants to open the camera in Iframe or not. If the value is set to true the camera will open and vice versa.

## Request Object Parameters
Shufti Pro offers exclusive services to its clients, and is tailored to meet users’ requests. You can choose one or all of the optional API keys.<br>
In case a key is given in document or address verification, and no value is provided, then OCR will be performed for those particular keys.
* ## Reference
    Required: **Yes**<br>
    Type: **string**<br>
    Minimum: **6 characters**<br>

    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **string**<br>
    Length: **2 characters**<br><br>
Input  2 characters long [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements)  country code of your client. Here is the list of [Countries](https://api.shuftipro.com/api/docs/#supported-countries) that Shufti Pro APIs support.

* ## Language
    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **string**<br>

* ## callback_url
    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **string**<br>
    Minimum: **6 characters**<br>
    Maximum: **250 characters**<br><br>
This generates several server-to-server calls to keep you updated about the verification status. This way you can update the request status at your end even if the customer is lost midway through the process.

* ## verification_mode
    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **string**<br>
    Accepted Values: **image_only, video_only, any**<br><br>

    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **string**<br>
    Accepted Values: **0, 1**<br><br>

    Required: **No**<br>
    Type: **string**<br>
    Accepted Values: **0, 1**<br><br>
This key specifies if the proof needs to be uploaded. The 1 value means that the user must upload the proof for verification and vice versa.

## Response Logging
Response of verification can be logged via the code given below. You can see this in LogCat at runtime. Write this code in the response listener of SDK:
```
//To view the errors of request
String error = responseSet.get("error");

Log.e("LoggingResp", error);

//To get the status of request
String event = responseSet.get("event");

if (event.equalsIgnoreCase("verification.accepted")) {

  //Verification accepted do whatever you want to do
  Log.i("LoggingResp", event);
} else {

  //Verification declined do whatever you want to do
  Log.i("LoggingResp", event);
}
```

## Status Response
The Shufti Pro Verification API will send a JSON response if a status request is made.
Reference: This is the user’s unique request reference provided at the time of request, in order for the unique response to be identified.
Event: The request event shows the status of the user's request and is different for every response. For more information, click here
Note: request.invalid response with HTTP status code 400 means the request is invalid.
Sample Response
{
  "reference": "17374217",
  "event": "request.declined",
  "error": "",
  "verification_url": ""
}
